Following changes from Jean-Pierre. Thank you.

 elimenating some status line visual artifacts.

05/18/02 0.71
Modified eeng.c, transpose to save undo data and indicate file changed.

05/17/02 0.70
BUGFIX: Changed eeng.c, file_fout. Would not save files from '/' being edited

Modified ws.c to unmark blocks for unshifted control keys.

05/16/02 0.69

 compatability with Win32 compilers.

05/14/02 0.68
Modified mye.c and eeng.c to use the same editor engine across the board for X
 and linux console. Win32 console does not compile static buffer code due to
 header file incompatability with 'void' pointers. Static buffer code OK.

 for a modified file.
