When I started using the RC2014 heavily, I needed to find a good editor.
That led me to ZDE, which led me to using joe(1) on my Lunix machine more.
It also increased the itch to write my own text editor. This repo is a
collection of text editors, so I could have them in one place.

EDITORS

+ mg - Dr. Callahan's portable version of OpenBSD's mg(1).
+ ue - Micro editor from the (now deceased) Terry Loveall.
+ edx - Minimal X editor from the (now deceased) Terry Loveall.
